# GDELT, Yahoo and Twitter stream

This is a demonstration on how to extract the public data across the world, feed it into data pipelines, and perform ETL/ELT as shown in each section diagram.

## Environments

* AWS
* Terraform
* S3
* Apache Kafka
* Apache Airflow
* Apache Spark
* Amazon Redshift
* Athena/Presto
* PostgreSQL
* ElasticSearch
* Docker

## Set up environments

## GDELT

<img src="img/gdelt-diagram.png" />

According to [GDELT website](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-2-0-our-global-world-in-realtime/), GDELT dataset is one of the largest and most ambitious platforms ever created for monitoring our global world. From realtime translation of the worldâ€™s news in 65 languages, to measurement of more than 2,300 emotions and themes from every article, to a massive inventory of the media of the non-Western world.

Many organizations have been using GDELT as the complementary datasets to enchance more new signals for their machine learning models. For example, [stock prices prediction](https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/theses/2178/), and [predicting community engagement](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/predicting-community-engagement-on-reddit-using-tensorflow-gdelt-and-cloud-dataflow-part-1)


In this project, I've downloaded both 15 minutes update "events" and "mentions" directly from [GDELT](http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv2/lastupdate.txt) and also scheduled scripts to download every 15 minutes automatically before uploading to S3 data lake so that Spectrum and Athena are able to query on top of S3.

* [gdelt-data](https://github.com/tharidlynn/gdelt/tree/master/gdelt-data)

Besides, AWS has been uploading GDELT events to [AWS S3 registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/gdelt/) everyday. Thus, we don't have to create scraping scripts to download the historical GDELT events by ourselves. I decided to use Apache Airflow as a glue between my custom code and AWS services.

## Yahoo finance

Back then, yahoo used to provide the Yahoo finance API for getting the market data. Unfortunately, it has been deprecated and cannot access anymore. So, I decided to write a little script that scrapes the [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and ingests data into PostgreSQL for us.

* [yahoo](https://github.com/tharidlynn/gdelt/tree/master/yahoo)

> Read replica is not required. You can execute it with `terraform apply -target module.yahoo_db_replica` for better performance.

## Twitter real time stream

The [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started) platform offers the way to stream realtime tweets which is nice because we can now capture the people sentiment in real time.
